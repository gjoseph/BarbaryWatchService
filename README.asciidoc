= BarbaryWatchService is retired

BarbaryWatchService was an implementation of Java 7's WatchService for Java 6 on Mac OS X. It was moved from https://code.google.com/p/barbarywatchservice/ to this repository in 2015,
shortly before I moved across the world, and stopped having any professional use for this library.
As evidenced by the complete lack of activity in this repo, I have had no spare time or energy to devote to it, and I am finally deciding to officially retire it.

If you're interested in the code, you can still find it in the `backup` branch. There are however more active and current alternatives, such as:

* https://github.com/gmethvin/directory-watcher

If you would like your alternative library listed here, that's probably the kind of PR I'll continue having time to review once in a while ;)
